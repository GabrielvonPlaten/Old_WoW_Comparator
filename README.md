All information is fetched from Blizzard's own API.

### Technologies

* Sass
* JavaScript

## How to use
Once you enter the website, click on the button **Start Comparing**. There, you have two fields for each player to field.
In the *Realm* field, you have to enter the realm of the character that resides in. And in the field below that, it is the *Name* field. There, you have to put the name of the character.

**If you do not know any combinations of the two**, here is a list of Realms and Names that will work if used together. The first is the *Realm Name*, the second is the character *Name*.
